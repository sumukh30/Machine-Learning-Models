Some of the popular ML Models   


1) Gold price prediction - predicts price of gold based on certain values.  
    Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/gold-price-data    
    Overview of data: This data file is a Comma separated value file format with 2290 rows and 7 columns. It contains 5 columns which are numerical in datatype and one     column in Date format. Clearly the data shows value of the variables SPX,GLD,USO,SLV,EUR/USD against the dates in the date column.  
   
   
2) Heart disease prediction - predicts if a person has heart disease or not.    
    1--> True(Heart disease)    
    0--> False(No Heart disease)    
    Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset    
    Overview of data: $ age 
                      $ sex 
                      $ chest pain type (4 values)  
                      $ resting blood pressure  
                      $ serum cholestoral in mg/dl  
                      $ fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl 
                      $ resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) 
                      $ maximum heart rate achieved 
                      $ exercise induced angina 
                      $ oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest    
                      $ the slope of the peak exercise ST segment   
                      $ number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
                      $ thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect   



                    lot more to come...!
